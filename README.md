An R Shiny dashboard provides a technical summary of B.C.'s mature forest stands by timber supply area (TSA).

---
## Readme

The purpose of this application is to deliver a comprehensive summary of timber supply-related forest attributes for mature stands in British Columbia using ground sample data collected through the Change Monitoring Inventory (CMI) and Vegetation Resources Inventory (VRI) program. The application is currently hosted at https://bcgov-env.shinyapps.io/mature_techrep/, and the data are updated annually based on newly collected ground samples.

## Features

Users can generate summaries at TSA levels. The available management units for the summaries appear under the "Select" menu.
The application features various tabs on the left, which display the reports for the selected management unit. Users can export the full report as an HTML document using the "Download report" button.
